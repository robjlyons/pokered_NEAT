## Compatibility levels

This edition has two versions: a low compatibility version and a high compatibility version.


### Low compatibility

* **Cheat compatibility**: Useful GameShark codes for the original edition should work with this ediiton without modification.
* **SRAM compatibility**: All game saves which work with the original edition should behave identically with this edition.


### High compatibility

The high-compatibility version has all constraints of the low-compatibility version as well as these constraints (except deliberate incompatibilities below):

* **Input compatibility**: For a given set of inputs (button presses), this edition and the original edition should behave identically.
* **Link compatibility**: Cable link battles and trades between a game of the original edition and a game of this edition should behave identical to cable link battles and trades between games of the original edition. This constraint also applies to battles and trades between two games of this edition.


### Deliberate incompatibilities

Given a game of the original edition (or any edition compatible with it), that game may be incompatible with a game of this edition (despite the compatibility constraints listed above) in the following ways:

* **Audio and video compatibility**: The sound and pixel output from a game of this edition may not exactly match the output from a game of the original edition.
* **Glitch effect compatibility**: After activating a glitch (assuming that glitch hasn't been fixed), the effects of the glitch won't be identical between a game of this edition and a game of the original edition.
* **Glitch trigger compatibility**: Glitches such as the old man glitch, the trainer-fly glitch, and the Pewter Gym escape glitch are not possible with this edition, despite being possible with the original edition.

For example, if a game save with MissingNo. is loaded with a game of this edition, MissingNo. may behave differently (e.g. learn different moves by leveling up).
